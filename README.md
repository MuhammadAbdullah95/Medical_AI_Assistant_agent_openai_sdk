# 🏥 Case Study: AI-Powered Medical Assistant — by BlueOrbitAi

## 🔍 Overview

The **Medical AI Chatbot** by **BlueOrbitAi** is a smart conversational agent designed to provide **accurate**, **real-time**, and **contextual** responses to medical queries. Using cutting-edge technologies like **Google Gemini**, **LangChain**, **OpenAI’s Agents SDK**, and **RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)**, it ensures users receive both **trusted knowledge base information** and **fresh insights from the web** via Google Search.

---

## ⚠️ The Problem

* Traditional chatbots lack **context-awareness** and rely on **static datasets**.
* Users demand **real-time**, **reliable**, and **detailed** health information.
* Health queries are often **multi-turn** and require **deeper reasoning**.

---

## 💡 The Solution

We developed an **agent-based AI chatbot** that:

* Retrieves context-rich responses using RAG.
* Uses **Google Search** to fetch the **latest medical knowledge**.
* Applies **reasoning and memory** to manage complex, multi-turn conversations.
* Offers a **clean, scalable API** and development UI using Chainlit.

## ✨ Key Features

| Feature                  | Description                                      |
| ------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------ |
| ✅ Medical Query Handling | General health Q\&A via Gemini and embedded data |
| ✅ Google Search Tool     | Fetches up-to-date online information            |
| ✅ RAG-Based Retrieval    | Retrieves relevant vector-embedded knowledge     |
| ✅ Multi-turn Context     | Remembers and builds on prior chat turns         |
| ✅ Custom Agent Tools     | Extends AI behavior with OpenAI Agents SDK       |
| ✅ FastAPI Backend        | Real-time, scalable, and secure API              |

## ⚙️ Tech Stack

* **Langchain** – Tool orchestration, agent logic
* **Pinecone** – Vector DB for fast similarity search
* **Google Gemini** – Main LLM for intelligent responses
* **OpenAI Agents SDK** – Tool-calling framework
* **Google Search API** – Real-time data enrichment
* **FastAPI** – Backend API service
* **Chainlit** – Chatbot development UI (optional)

---

## 🧠 How It Works

1. User asks a medical question (e.g., “What are early signs of heart disease?”).
2. The **main agent** decides whether to:

   * Use **RAG** to retrieve answers from internal vector DB.
   * Or invoke **Google Search** for current studies/articles.
3. Gemini generates a **summarized, accurate response**.
4. Agent tracks context for follow-up questions in multi-turn conversations.
